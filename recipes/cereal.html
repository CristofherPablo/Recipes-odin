      Make your own chewy energy/granola bars with a not-too-sweet chocolate
      flavor with hints of coconut and almond.

      Chocolate Cereal Breakfast Bars – Better, Cheaper, and Way More Personal
      When we were moving in, before the kitchen was set up, Michele and I would
      have a box of granola bars around for emergency snacking purposes, and
      while they served the purpose, every time I ate one I couldn't help
      feeling guilty since they're never great, often disappointing, and always
      expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      What added to this culinary self-loathing is the fact that I know just how
      fast, easy and inexpensive this kind of thing is to make at home, which is
      what I'm happily sharing here. I'm still okay with the occasional
      store-bought bar, especially if it keeps you out of the fast food
      drive-through, but these really are superior in every way.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn't really a specific recipe, but rather a simple method that
      allows you to create customized breakfast bars, energy bars, power bars,
      sports bars, or whatever you decide to call them. Pretty much any
      ready-to-eat breakfast grain or cereal can work here, along with all you
      favorite nuts, seeds, and dried fruits. No matter what goes in yours, I
      really do hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!
