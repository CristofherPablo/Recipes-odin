      <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
      <li>2 celery ribs, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can beef broth</li>
      <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle stout (such as GuinnessÂ®) or porter</li>
      <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
      <li>3 sprigs fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Direction</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Step 1</dt>
      <dd>
        Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large, wide pot over medium-high heat until
        oil begins to smoke. Sear lamb shanks in hot oil on all sides until
        browned, about 10 minutes. Remove lamb shanks and set aside. Drain
        excess grease.
      </dd>
      <dt>Step 2</dt>
      <dd>
        Add onion and garlic to the Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir
        until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in
        carrots, celery, and tomato paste; cook for 5 minutes more.
      </dd>
      <dt>Step 3</dt>
      <dd>
        BReturn lamb shanks to the Dutch oven and pour in broth and stout beer.
        Use kitchen twine to tie together thyme, parsley, and bay leaf into a
        secure bundle; add to lamb shanks. Bring to a boil.
      </dd>
      <dt>Step 4</dt>
      <dd>
        Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally,
        until lamb is tender and nearly falls off the bone, 2 to 3 hours. Stir
        in rosemary sprig and season with salt and pepper during the last 10
        minutes of cooking. Remove rosemary sprig and herb bundle before
        serving.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
      You can add water in step 4 to keep the cooking liquid from becoming too
      thick. The cooking liquid should reduce into a nice sauce when lamb shanks
      are done.
